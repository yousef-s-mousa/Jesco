"novel-orange":{

"p2": "The secondary orange is of vast importance, because it causes the orange to be seedless. Since these fruits lack seeds, farmers had to use techniques like cutting and grafting to continue producing the tree. As a result, every navel orange can be considered a product of that single tree planted over 200 years ago! The Navel Orange stands alone as the ultimate orange for eating out of hand. Neither overly tart, nor sweet, the Navel Orange produces outstanding orange juice, and can be easily segmented and shared with friends - that is, if you're willing to share.",
